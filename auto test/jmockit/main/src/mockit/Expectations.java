/**
 * Used to record <em>strict</em> expectations on {@linkplain Mocked mocked} types and mocked instances.
 * It should be noted that strict expectations are rather stringent, and can lead to brittle tests.
 * Users should first consider <em>non-strict</em> expectations instead, which can be recorded with the
 * {@link NonStrictExpectations} class.
 * <p/>
 * A recorded expectation is intended to match one or more method or constructor invocations, that we expect will occur
 * during the execution of some code under test.
 * When a match is detected, the recorded {@linkplain #result result} is returned to the caller.
 * Alternatively, a recorded exception/error is thrown, or an arbitrary {@linkplain Delegate delegate} method is
 * executed.
 * Expectations are recorded simply by invoking the desired method or constructor on the mocked type/instance, during
 * the initialization of an {@code Expectations} object.
 * Typically, this is done by instantiating an anonymous subclass containing an instance initialization body, or as we
 * call it, an <em>expectation block</em>:
 * <pre>
 * // <em>Record</em> one or more expectations on available mocked types/instances.
 * new Expectations() {{
 *    <strong>mock1</strong>.expectedMethod(anyInt); result = 123; times = 2;
 *    <strong>mock2</strong>.anotherExpectedMethod(1, "test"); result = new String[] {"Abc", "xyz"};
 * }};
 *
 * // Exercise tested code, with previously recorded expectations now available for <em>replay</em>.
 * codeUnderTest.doSomething();
 * </pre>
 * During replay, invocations matching recorded expectations must occur in the exact same number and order as specified
 * in the expectation block.
 * Invocations that don't match any recorded expectation, on the other hand, will cause an "unexpected invocation" error
 * to be thrown.
 * Even more, if an expectation was recorded but no matching invocations occurred, a "missing invocation" error will
 * be thrown at the end of the test.
 * <p/>
 * There are several special fields and methods which can be used in the expectation block, to: a) record desired return
 * values or exceptions/errors to be thrown ({@link #result}, {@link #returns(Object, Object...)}); b) relax or
 * constrain the matching of argument values ({@link #anyInt}, {@link #anyString}, {@link #withNotNull()}, etc.);
 * c) relax or constrain the expected and/or allowed number of matching invocations ({@link #times}, {@link #minTimes},
 * {@link #maxTimes}).
 * <p/>
 * By default, the exact instance on which instance method invocations will occur is <em>not</em> verified to be the
 * same as the instance used when recording the expectation.
 * That said, instance-specific matching can be obtained by annotating the mock field/parameter as
 * {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable}, or by using the {@link #onInstance(Object)} method.
 *
 * @see #Expectations()

   /**
    * A value assigned to this field will be taken as the result for the expectation that is being recorded.
    * <p/>
    * If the value is a {@link Throwable} then it will be <em>thrown</em> when a matching invocation later occurs.
    * Otherwise, it's assumed to be a <em>return value</em> for a non-<code>void</code> method, and will be returned
    * from a matching invocation.
    * <p/>
    * If no result is recorded for a given expectation, then all matching invocations will return the appropriate
    * default value according to the method return type:
    * <ul>
    * <li>{@code String}: returns {@code null}.</li>
    * <li>Primitive or primitive wrapper: the standard default value is returned (ie {@code false} for
    * {@code boolean/Boolean}, {@code '\0'} for {@code char/Character}, {@code 0} for {@code int/Integer}, and so on).
    * </li>
    * <li>{@code java.util.Collection} or {@code java.util.List}: returns {@link Collections#EMPTY_LIST}.</li>
    * <li>{@code java.util.Set}: returns {@link Collections#EMPTY_SET}.</li>
    * <li>{@code java.util.SortedSet}: returns an unmodifiable empty sorted set.</li>
    * <li>{@code java.util.Map}: returns {@link Collections#EMPTY_MAP}.</li>
    * <li>{@code java.util.SortedMap}: returns an unmodifiable empty sorted map.</li>
    * <li>A reference type, except for the collection types above: returns {@code null}.</li>
    * <li>An array type: returns an array with zero elements (empty) in each dimension.</li>
    * </ul>
    * <p/>
    * When an expectation is recorded for a method which actually <em>returns</em> an exception or error (as opposed to
    * <em>throwing</em> one), then the {@link #returns(Object, Object...)} method should be used instead, as it only
    * applies to return values.
    * <p/>
    * Assigning a value whose type differs from the method return type will cause an {@code IllegalArgumentException} to
    * be thrown, unless it can be safely converted to the return type.
    * One such conversion is from an array to a collection or iterator.
    * Another is from an array of at least two dimensions to a map, with the first dimension providing the keys and the
    * second the values.
    * Yet another conversion is from a single value to a container type holding that value.
    * <p/>
    * Additionally, if the value assigned to the field is an array or is of a type assignable to {@link Iterable} or
    * {@link Iterator}, and the return type is single-valued, then the assigned multi-valued result is taken as a
    * sequence of <em>consecutive results</em> for the expectation.
    * <p/>
    * Results that depend on some programming logic can be provided through a {@linkplain mockit.Delegate} object
    * assigned to the field.
    * This applies to {@code void} and non-<code>void</code> methods, as well as to constructors.
    * <p/>
    * Finally, when recording an expectation on a <em>constructor</em> of a mocked class, an arbitrary instance of said
    * class can be assigned to the field.
    * In this case, the assigned instance will be used as a "replacement" for all invocations to
    * <em>instance methods</em> made on <em>other</em> instances, provided they get created sometime later through a
    * matching constructor invocation.
