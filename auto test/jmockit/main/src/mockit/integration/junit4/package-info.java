/**
 * Provides integration with <em>JUnit 4.x</em> test runners, for version 4.5 or newer.
 * Contains the {@link mockit.integration.junit4.JMockit} custom class runner.
 * <p/>
 * This integration provides the following benefits to test code:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Expected invocations specified through the Expectations or Mockups API are automatically verified before the
 * execution of a test is completed.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Mock-up classes applied with the Mockups API from inside a method annotated as a {@code @Test} or a
 * {@code @Before} method are discarded right after the execution of the test method or the whole test, respectively.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Test methods accept <em>mock parameters</em>, whose values are mocked instances automatically created by JMockit and
 * passed by the test runner when the test method is executed.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
