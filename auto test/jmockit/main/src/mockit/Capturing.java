/**
 * Indicates a mock field or a mock parameter for which all classes extending/implementing the
 * {@linkplain Mocked mocked} type will <em>also</em> get mocked.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Future</em> instances of a captured class (ie, instances created sometime later during the test) are also said to
 * be captured.
 * Once captured, they become associated with the corresponding mock field/parameter, and are considered as equivalent
 * to the original mock instance created for the mock field/parameter, when matching invocations to expectations.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #maxInstances} attribute allows an upper limit to the number of captured instances to be specified.
 * If multiple capturing mock fields/parameters of the same type are declared, this attribute can be used so that each
 * distinct instance gets associated with a separate mock field/parameter.
 * <p/>
 * Note that, once a capturing mocked type is in scope, the capture of implementation classes and their instances can
 * happen at any moment before the first expected invocation is recorded, or during the recording and replay phases.
