/**
 * Used to <em>verify</em> a set of non-strict expectations on available {@linkplain Mocked mocked} types and/or
 * instances, against the invocations which actually occurred during the test.
 * As such, these verifications can only appear <em>after</em> having exercised the code under test.
 * <p/>
 * An expectation verification attempts to match a number of method or constructor invocations, that we expect have
 * occurred during the execution of code under test.
 * By default, <em>at least one</em> matching invocation must be found for the verification to be successful; if no
 * matching invocations are found, an assertion error is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Expectations are verified simply by invoking the desired method or constructor on a mocked type/instance, during
 * the initialization of a {@code Verifications} object.
 * Typically, this is done by instantiating an anonymous subclass containing an instance initialization body, or as we
 * call it, a <em>verification block</em>:
 * <pre>
 * // Exercise tested code.
 * codeUnderTest.doSomething();
 *
 * // Now verify that the expected invocations actually occurred (in any order).
 * new Verifications() {{
 *    <strong>mock1</strong>.expectedMethod(anyInt);
 *    <strong>mock2</strong>.anotherExpectedMethod(1, "test"); times = 2;
 * }};
 * </pre>
 * The relative order between the invocations that match two or more verifications is not taken into
 * consideration; when that is desired, the {@link VerificationsInOrder} class should be used instead.
 * <p/>
 * Naturally, not all invocations that occurred during the execution of code under test need to be explicitly verified
 * in a verification block.
 * If desired, however, we can make sure that <em>all</em> such invocations are verified, by using the
 * {@link FullVerifications} class instead.
