/**
 * Indicates an instance field of a test class as being a <em>mock field</em>, or a parameter of a test method as a
 * <em>mock parameter</em>; in either case, the declared type of the field/parameter is a <em>mocked type</em>, whose
 * instances are <em>mocked instances</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Any type can be mocked, except for primitive and array types.
 * A mocked instance of that type is automatically created and assigned to the mock field/parameter, for use when
 * {@linkplain NonStrictExpectations recording} or {@linkplain Verifications verifying} expectations.
 * <p/>
 * The effect of declaring a {@code @Mocked} type, by default, is that all new instances of that type, as well as those
 * previously created, will also be mocked instances; this will last for the duration of each test where the associated
 * mock field/parameter is in scope.
 * Also, all methods of the mocked type will be mocked, unless a subset is {@linkplain #value explicitly specified}.
 * <p/>
 * When the mocked type is a class, all super-classes up to but not including {@code java.lang.Object} are also mocked.
 * Additionally, <em>static methods</em> and <em>constructors</em> are mocked as well, just like instance methods.
 * <p/>
 * When mocking an {@code enum} type, the {@code java.lang.Enum} base class is <em>not</em> mocked by default.
 * If needed, however, base types like {@code Object} and {@code Enum} can be mocked by explicitly declaring a mock
 * field or mock parameter of the specific base type.
 * <p/>
 * While a method or constructor is mocked, an invocation does not result in the execution of the original code, but in
 * a (generated) call into JMockit, which then responds with either a default or a <em>recorded</em> result (or with a
 * constraint violation, if the invocation is deemed to be unexpected - which depends on a few factors discussed
 * elsewhere).
 * <p/>
 * Static <em>class initializers</em> (including assignments to {@code static} fields) of a mocked class are not
 * affected, unless {@linkplain #stubOutClassInitialization specified otherwise}.
 * <p/>
 * Normally, a new mocked instance gets created and assigned to a declared mock field/parameter automatically.
 * An exception to that occurs in the case of a mocked {@code enum} type, where the first enumeration element is used.
 * Alternatively, and only in the case of a mock <em>field</em>, the test itself can provide the instance by declaring
 * the field as {@code final} and explicitly assigning it with the desired instance (which will still be a mocked
 * instance); if no instance is necessary (perhaps because only static methods or constructors will be called), then
 * this final field can receive the {@code null} reference.
 * Mock parameters, on the other hand, will always receive a new mocked instance whenever the test method is executed by
 * the test runner.

    * Each mock filter must follow the syntax <strong>{@code [nameRegex][(paramTypeName...)]}</strong>, where
    * {@code nameRegex} is a {@linkplain java.util.regex.Pattern regular expression} for matching method names, and
    * {@code paramTypeName} is the name of a primitive or reference parameter type (actually, any suffix of the type

    * <p/>
    * By default, static initialization code in a mocked class is <em>not</em> stubbed out.
    * The JVM will only perform static initialization of a class <em>once</em>, so stubbing out the initialization code
    * can have unexpected consequences.
    * Static initialization will occur the first time the class is instantiated, has a static method called on it, or
    * has a static field whose value is defined at runtime accessed; these are the only events which prompt the JVM to
    * initialize a class.
    * If the original class initialization code was stubbed out, then it will not be there to be executed at the time of
    * static initialization, potentially leaving static fields {@code null} and later causing
    * {@code NullPointerException}'s to occur.
