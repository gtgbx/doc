<p>
   Lets say we have a business service class which provides a business operation with the following responsibilities:
   a) it finds certain persistent entities needed by the operation;
   b) it persists the state for a new entity; and
   c) it sends a notification e-mail to an interested party.
   The first two responsibilities require access to the application database, which is done through a simplified API to
   the persistence subsystem.
   The third one can be achieved with a third-party API for sending e-mail, which in this example is the
   <a href="http://commons.apache.org/email">Commons Email</a> library.
</p>
<p>
   Therefore, the service class has two separate dependencies, one for persistence and another for e-mail.
   In order to unit test the business operation while verifying proper interaction with these collaborators, we will use
   the available mocking APIs.
   Complete source code for a working solution - with all tests - is available
   <a href="http://jmockit.org/source/browse/trunk#trunk/samples/tutorial">online</a> and under
   <code>samples/tutorial</code> in the full distribution zip file.
</p>
<pre><code>package jmockit.tutorial.domain;

import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;
import org.apache.commons.mail.*;
import static jmockit.tutorial.persistence.Database.*;

public final class MyBusinessService
{
   public void doBusinessOperationXyz(EntityX data) throws EmailException
   {
      List&lt;EntityX> items =
(1)      <em>find</em>("select item from EntityX item where item.someProperty = ?1", data.getSomeProperty());

      // Compute or obtain from another service a total value for the new persistent entity:
      BigDecimal total = ...
      data.setTotal(total);

(2)   <em>persist</em>(data);

      sendNotificationEmail(data, items);
   }

   private void sendNotificationEmail(EntityX data, List&lt;EntityX> items) throws EmailException
   {
      Email email = new SimpleEmail();
      email.setSubject("Notification about processing of ...");
(3)   email.addTo(data.getCustomerEmail());

      // Other e-mail parameters, such as the host name of the mail server, have defaults defined
      // through external configuration.

      String message = buildNotificationMessage(items);
      email.setMsg(message);

(4)   email.send();
   }

   private String buildNotificationMessage(List&lt;EntityX> items) { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <code class="type">Database</code> class contains only static methods and a private constructor; the
   <code>find</code> and <code>persist</code> methods should be obvious, so we won't list them here (assume they are
   implemented on top of an ORM API, such as Hibernate or JPA).
</p>
<div class="sidebar">
   Here we show the tests <em>after</em> the tested code, but this is not to say that the JMockit APIs are meant for
   testing <em>legacy</em> code. Before anything else, they were designed to <em>enable</em> the creation of unit tests
   for clean and simple production code, without imposing arbitrary constraints on the design of said code.
</div>
<p>
   So, how can we unit test the "doBusinessOperationXyz" method without making any changes to the existing application
   code?
   JMockit actually provides three different mocking APIs, each capable enough for our needs.
   (In practice, the first two APIs are just subsets of a larger <em>behavior-oriented</em> mocking API; the other one,
   which can be described as an <em>state-oriented</em> mocking API, is truly different and unique.)
   We will see how to use each one of them in the following sections.
   In every situation, a JUnit test case will verify the invocations of interest made from the unit under test to its
   external dependencies. These invocations are the ones at points <code>(1)</code>-<code>(4)</code> indicated above.

<p>
   First, lets use the <strong>JMockit Expectations</strong> API.
</p>
<pre><code>package jmockit.tutorial.domain;

import org.apache.commons.mail.*;
import jmockit.tutorial.persistence.*;

import org.junit.*;
import mockit.*;

public final class MyBusinessService_ExpectationsAPI_Test
{
   @Mocked(stubOutClassInitialization = true) final Database unused = null;
   @Mocked SimpleEmail email;

   @Test
   public void doBusinessOperationXyz() throws Exception
   {
      final EntityX data = new EntityX(5, "abc", "abc@xpta.net");

      // Recorded strictly, so matching invocations must be replayed in the same order:
      new Expectations() {{
(1)      Database.<em>find</em>(withSubstring("select"), <em>any</em>);
         <em>result</em> = new EntityX(1, "AX5", "someone@somewhere.com");

(2)      Database.<em>persist</em>(data);
      }};

      // Recorded non-strictly, so matching invocations can be replayed in any order:
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
(4)      email.send(); <em>times</em> = 1; // a non-strict invocation requires a constraint if expected
      }};

      new MyBusinessService().doBusinessOperationXyz(data);
   }

   @Test(expected = EmailException.class)
   public void doBusinessOperationXyzWithInvalidEmailAddress() throws Exception
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
(3)      email.addTo((String) withNotNull()); <em>result</em> = new EmailException();

         // If the e-mail address is invalid, sending the message should not be attempted:
         email.send(); <em>times</em> = 0;
      }};

      EntityX data = new EntityX(5, "abc", "someone@somewhere.com");
      new MyBusinessService().doBusinessOperationXyz(data);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<div class="sidebar">
   Other mocking tools usually require a call to some mock creation method, which always returns a new object which
   later needs to be passed to the code under test.
   In JMockit, such instances may be passed to code under test, but don't have to be.
   In fact, no instance may be used at all, like in the case of <code>final Database unused = null;</code> used in the
   example tests.
</div>
<p>
   First of all, note that <em>what</em> gets mocked is specified through <em>mock fields</em>, which in this case are
   instance fields of the test class annotated as <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>.
   A mock field can be of any reference type: an interface, an abstract class, a final/non-final class, an enum type, an
   annotation type, or even a generic type parameter.
   We say that such a mock field has a <em>mocked type</em>.
   In truth, it is the type specified to be mocked that actually matters; the field itself is not essential, although
   very useful when the test needs a <em>mocked object</em> to record expectations on.
   Such a mocked instance will be automatically created and assigned to the field, so it will never be left with a
   <code>null</code> reference.
   It is possible to "take over" the value assigned to the mock field, though, by simply declaring it as
   <code>final</code>.
</p>
<p>
   By default, all methods of a class declared as a mocked type will be <em>mocked</em>, that is, they will be modified
   so that the actual method implementation in production code is never executed as long as the type stays mocked.
   The same holds true for the constructors of a mocked class.
   Class initialization code (in <code>static</code> blocks and/or non-compile time assignments to <code>static</code>
   fields) can be <em>stubbed out</em> when needed, as done above for the
   <a href="http://jmockit.org/source/browse/trunk/samples/tutorial/src/jmockit/tutorial/persistence/Database.java">
      <code class="type">Database</code></a> class.
   (This isn't done by default because the JVM can only initialize a class <em>once</em>, potentially resulting in
   <code>static</code> fields left <code>null</code> when the class is initialized while mocked.)
</p>
<p>
   Notice that JMockit Expectations does not create any mock subclasses for concrete mocked classes;
   instead, it directly modifies the actual implementation of the mocked class.
   On the other hand, methods of an interface and <code>abstract</code> methods do not contain any implementation to be
   modified.
   In such cases, an empty implementation body is provided in a concrete implementation class.
   This is all done automatically by JMockit in a transparent way, with no additional effort on the part of the
   developer.
   Finally, note that this makes <em>every</em> instance of a mocked class a <em>mocked instance</em>, for as long as
   the class remains mocked - there is no separate "mock object" per se.
</p>
<div class="sidebar">
   JMockit switches automatically from the <em>expectations recording phase</em> to the <em>replay phase</em> of the
   test.
   In EasyMock, a call to <code>replay(mock)</code> is needed for each mock used in the test to make this switch.
   In jMock there is also a phase switching method, which takes the form of a call to the
   <code>Mockery#checking(...)</code> method with an instance of an <code class="type">org.jmock.Expectations</code>
   subclass.
</div>
<p>
   As the example tests show, <em>expected</em> or <em>allowed invocations</em> are specified through regular method and
   constructor invocations on mocked classes or mock fields, while inside an <code class="type">Expectations</code> or
   <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> <em>block</em> (which is an anonymous inner class containing an
   instance initialization block). Each such invocation partly defines an <em>expectation</em> for the test.
</p>
<p>
   We say that such invocations or expectations are <em>recorded</em> during a <em>record phase</em>, so that they can
   be <em>replayed</em> (and optionally verified) later, during a <em>replay phase</em>.
   Typically, this second phase of the test starts with the call that exercises the code under test,
   and lasts until the test execution completes.
   This is known as the <em>record-replay model</em> of test execution.
   Note that the record/replay dichotomy applies to each individual expectation, not to the test as whole.
   That is, a test method <em>can</em> switch between the record and replay phases any number of times with different
   expectations; doing so, however, would lead to confusing tests and is therefore highly discouraged, even if valid.
</p>
<p>
   Additional behavior can and often is specified for an expectation.
   This is done by assigning values to certain fields and/or calling certain methods of the Expectations API,
   <em>after</em> the recorded method/constructor invocation of interest, and <em>before</em> the next expectation to
   appear in the block.
   A <em>recorded return value</em> of any type can be assigned to the special <strong><code>result</code></strong>
   field.
   Similarly, a <em>recorded exception</em> (or <em>error</em>) can be specified by assigning the desired
   <code class="type">Throwable</code> instance to this same <code>result</code> field.
</p>
<p>
   The method calls "<strong><code>withXyz(...)</code></strong>", as well as the field accesses
   "<strong><code>anyAbc</code></strong>", allow flexible matching of argument values for the recorded invocations.
   Otherwise, an exact match is expected between recorded argument values and the corresponding values received in the
   replay phase.
</p>
<div class="sidebar">
   JMockit automatically verifies all strict expectations before the end of the test, with no extra input from the
   developer.
   In EasyMock it is necessary to explicitly call <code>verify(mock)</code> for each mock used in the test.
   jMock also automatically performs an equivalent verification at the end of each test, as long as
   you specify <code class="annotation">@RunWith</code><code>(JMock.class)</code> for the test class.
</div>
<p>
   All expectations recorded inside <code class="type">Expectations</code> blocks are <em>strictly verified</em>
   before the end of the test.
   <em>Non-strict</em> expectations (those appearing inside a <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> block) are
   only verified if an explicit <em>invocation count constraint</em> is specified in the test, through an assignment to
   the <strong><code>times</code></strong> field (or alternatively to the <strong><code>minTimes</code></strong> and/or
   <strong><code>maxTimes</code></strong> fields).
   A <code class="type">java.lang.AssertionError</code> will be thrown for any expected invocation which did not happen
   during the replay phase.
   An error will also be thrown for any invocation to a mocked type that does occur during the replay phase, but which
   was expected to <em>not</em> occur; all the unrecorded invocations to strictly mocked types will cause such an error,
   and also the ones recorded (strictly or not) with a minimum invocation count which gets violated at replay time.
   Even more, the test will fail (again, with an <code class="type">AssertionError</code>) if expected invocations to
   one or more strict mocked types are replayed in a different order than they were recorded.
</p>
<p>
   There is more to the Expectations API, about which you can find in the chapter on
   <a href="BehaviorBasedTesting.html">behavior-based testing</a>, in the
   <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Expectations.html">API documentation</a>, and also in the many additional sample tests
   inside the full distribution.

<p>
   Up to this point we focused on expectations that are recorded/specified <em>before</em> exercising the code under
   test.
   Such expectations are verified implicitly (when strict or with an specified invocation count constraint) or not at
   all (when non-strict and without any associated invocation count constraint).
   Lets now consider the use of the <strong>JMockit Verifications</strong> API, which lets us explicitly verify
   expectations <em>after</em> having exercised the code under test.
</p>
<pre><code>package jmockit.tutorial.domain;

import org.apache.commons.mail.*;
import jmockit.tutorial.persistence.*;

import org.junit.*;
import mockit.*;

public final class MyBusinessService_VerificationsAPI_Test
{
   @Tested MyBusinessService service; // instantiated automatically
   @Mocked(stubOutClassInitialization = true) Database onlyStatics;
   @Capturing Email email; // concrete subclass mocked on demand, when loaded

   final EntityX data = new EntityX(5, "abc", "someone@somewhere.com");

   @Test
   public void doBusinessOperationXyzPersistsData() throws Exception
   {
      // No expectations recorded in this case.

      service.doBusinessOperationXyz(data);

(2)   new Verifications() {{ Database.<em>persist</em>(data); }};
   }

   @Test
   public void doBusinessOperationXyzFindsItemsAndSendsNotificationEmail() throws Exception
   {
      // Invocations that produce a result are recorded, but only those we care about.
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
(1)      Database.<em>find</em>(withSubstring("select"), (Object[]) null);
         <em>result</em> = new EntityX(1, "AX5", "someone@somewhere.com");
      }};

      service.doBusinessOperationXyz(data);

      new VerificationsInOrder() {{
(3)      email.addTo(data.getCustomerEmail());
(4)      email.send();
      }};
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   To recapitulate, <em>non-strict</em> expectations differ from <em>strict</em> ones in that they can be executed or
   not by code under test, even if they were not previously recorded.
   And if they are executed the relative order between invocations doesn't matter, unless specified otherwise.
</p>
<p>
   The example tests above show two ways to have non-strict expectations: first, by simply having no expectation block
   at all; second, by specifying expectations inside a <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> block.
   In the first case, all invocations to mocked types made in production code will be allowed without restrictions, but
   non-void mocked methods will always return a fixed default value according to the method return type.
   Obviously, this won't always be appropriate, so an expectation block of some kind containing recorded invocations
   will be needed.
</p>
<p>
   When we use non-strict expectations, invocations to mocked methods and constructors during the replay phase are not
   immediately verified (unless explicitly specified otherwise through an invocation count constraint).
   Those non-strict invocations which were recorded with an specific return value or with an exception/error to be
   thrown will produce the expected result if and when replayed by production code.
</p>
<p>
   The fact that an explicitly recorded non-strict expectation allows the test to pass is usually enough evidence to
   demonstrate that the tested unit did the right thing.
   In the second test above for example, suppose the line recording a result for the <code>Database.find(...)</code>
   invocation is commented out.
   The test will likely fail when another part of the code under test which depends on that returned value is executed,
   or when an expected invocation is verified in the test itself (in this example test, an extra
   <code>email.setMsg(withNotEqual(""));</code> verification would be needed between the other two verified
   invocations).
   However, in some cases you may want to be sure that the invocation will occur at least once.
   To achieve that, simply specify it with a <code><em>minTimes</em> = 1</code> constraint after the recorded invocation
   in the non-strict expectation block.
</p>
<div class="sidebar">
   Two other mocking toolkits which provide explicit verification after the replay phase are <strong>Mockito</strong>
   and <strong>Unitils Mock</strong>.
   Besides significant differences in power and API style, they lack JMockit's ability to specify invocation count
   constraints on recorded expectations, thereby forcing the developer to explicitly verify all expected invocations.
   In addition, JMockit supports both kinds of expectations, not only the non-strict kind supported exclusively in
   Mockito and Unitils.
</div>
<p>
   Another advantage of non-strict expectations is that they can be explicitly verified in test code.
   Such verifications are just like the recording of invocations: simply invoke the method or constructor to be
   verified, but inside a <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Verifications.html"><code class="type">Verifications</code></a>
   block (or a subclass such as <a href="../javadoc/mockit/VerificationsInOrder.html">
   <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code></a>, which also verifies the relative order of execution).
   Such blocks must always be executed <em>after</em> the code under test was exercised, that is, after the end of the
   replay phase.
   Note that verification blocks will typically contain invocations to constructors and methods of <code>void</code>
   return type.
   Non-void methods can be explicitly verified as well (even if recorded previously in the test), although as we saw
   before they will also be implicitly verified if an invocation count constraint was specified in the record phase.
</p>
<p>
   Syntactically, a <em>verification block</em> is just like an expectation block.
   Invocations to mocked types are immediately verified to match corresponding invocations made during the replay phase.
   Argument matching constraints can be used so that a single invocation in a verification block verifies several
   invocations executed by the code under test.
   The invocation count for a particular method or constructor can be verified by specifying constraints through one of
   the <code>times</code>, <code>minTimes</code>, and <code>maxTimes</code> fields, just like it can be done for
   expectations in the recording phase.
   In particular, it can be verified that an specific invocation never happened by specifying a
   <code><em>times</em> = 0</code> invocation count constraint (or <code><em>maxTimes</em> = 0</code> if preferred).

   Next, lets see how the <strong>JMockit Mockups</strong> API solves the problem.

         @Mock(invocations = 0)
         String send() { return null; }
      };
   
      new MyBusinessService().doBusinessOperationXyz(data);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Here, instead of recording or verifying expectations through invocations to mocked types, we directly specify
   <em>mock implementations</em> for the methods and constructors of interest.
   Such <em>mock methods</em> must have the same signature as the "real" methods and constructors, and be annotated with
   <code class="annotation">@Mock</code>.
   They are defined in a <em>mock class</em>, which can either be a separate class (nested or not) or an anonymous inner
   class defined inside a test method; in either case, it must extend the generic
   <a href="../javadoc/mockit/MockUp.html"><code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code></a> base class, while providing the
   type to be mocked as the "value" for the type parameter <code>T</code>.
</p>
<p>
   The two tests above share a reusable mock class, <code class="type">MockDatabase</code>, which is applied to
   the test class as a whole in an <code class="annotation">@BeforeClass</code> method.
   Notice that we also stub out static initializers in the <code class="type">Database</code> class, by defining the
   special mock method "<code>$clinit()</code>".
   This is necessary in this case because the
   <a href="http://jmockit.org/source/browse/trunk/samples/tutorial/src/jmockit/tutorial/persistence/Database.java">
      <code class="type">Database</code></a>
   class actually creates a JPA <code class="type">EntityManagerFactory</code> instance during its static
   initialization.
</p>
<p>
   Each test sets up specific mocks for the <code class="type">Email</code> class by creating an inline (anonymous)
   <em>mock-up class</em> instance.
   As seen in some of these mock methods, the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> annotation can optionally specify
   exact/min/max constraints on the expected/allowed number of invocations to the corresponding real method.
   Although not shown here, constructors can be mocked with mock methods named "<strong><code>$init</code></strong>" and
   having the same parameters as the constructor to be mocked.
</p>
<p>
   Typically, the majority of tests can be written with the Expectations & Verifications API.
   There are situations, however, where the Mockups API can be an useful complement to that.
