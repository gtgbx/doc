/**
 * This class is a <em>static facade</em> for persistence operations.
 * All methods are {@code static}, so it can be statically imported in client classes for maximum usability.
 * <p/>
 * All of the persistence operations made available through this facade access a thread-bound <em>persistence
 * context</em>. In this particular implementation, the standard <strong>JPA</strong> API is used, where
 * {@code javax.persistence.EntityManager} represents a work unit. Typically, each work unit instance exists only long
 * enough to perform a single database transaction. Transaction demarcation is not a responsibility of this class,
 * however, which simply keeps the association between the current thread and a dedicated work unit object (an
 * {@code EntityManager} instance).
 * (In a web app, the persistence context can be tied to the HTTP request/response cycle, which normally runs entirely
 * in a single thread for each request/response pair; a central action-dispatch servlet can commit or rollback the
 * current transaction, while a custom {@code javax.servlet.Filter} can close the thread-bound {@code EntityManager}.)
 * <p/>
 * Compared to direct use of an ORM API such as JPA, or to the use of <em>Data Access Objects</em> (the "DAO" pattern),
 * this <em>static persistence facade</em> pattern has several advantages.
 * Mainly, client code which needs to perform high-level persistence operations (such as persisting a new entity
 * instance, deleting an already persisted entity, or finding and loading persistent entities) tends to be simpler and
 * shorter.
 * In the case of entity-specific DAO classes, potentially thousands of lines of code are saved, without any real loss
 * in portability (the facade implementation can adapt to new versions of the ORM API or even a different ORM API; and
 * consider that switching between an ORM API and plain use of JDBC is not viable anyway, since with JDBC the DAO
 * classes need to expose methods for the execution of "UPDATE" statements, which are not needed with modern ORM APIs).
