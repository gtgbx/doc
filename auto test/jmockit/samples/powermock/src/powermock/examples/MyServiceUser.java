/**
 * A simple service class that uses the {@link DependencyManager} to get the {@link MyService}
 * singleton instance. This is the class that we want to test. What's interesting in this example is
 * the static call to the <code>DependencyManager</code>. Without byte-code manipulation (provided
 * in this example by PowerMock) it would not be possible to return a mock from the call to
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * DependencyManager.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of this example is to demonastrate how to mock that static method.
