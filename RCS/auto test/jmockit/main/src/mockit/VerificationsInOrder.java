   /**
    * Accounts for a sequence of invocations executed by code under test that are not explicitly verified in any
    * verification block.
    * Such a "sequence" of invocations can include only a single invocation, or even be empty.
    * <p/>
    * Invocations matching an expectation recorded with a minimum invocation count - if any - are <em>also</em>
    * included here, since their replay order could not be verified otherwise.
    * This doesn't apply to <em>strict</em> expectations, though, since in that case the replay order must be as
    * recorded.
    * <p/>
    * This method can be used to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred <em>before</em> others, and
    * conversely to verify that one or more consecutive invocations occurred <em>after</em> others.
    * The call to this method marks the position where the unverified invocations are expected to have occurred,
    * relative to the explicitly verified ones.
    * <p/>
    * The exact sequence of unverified invocations accounted for by a particular call to this method depends on the
    * <em>position</em> of the call relative to other verifications.
    * Each grouping of explicit verifications will correspond to a sequence of <em>consecutive</em> (and verified)
    * invocations from the code under test.
    * So, if this method is called more than once from the same verification block, each call will account for a
    * separate sequence of unverified invocations; each sequence will be verified to occur, as a whole, in the same
    * order as it appears relative to those groupings of verified invocations.
    * <p/>
    * Notice that when this method is not used, the invocations from code under test need <em>not</em> be consecutive,
    * but only have the same relative order as the verification calls.
    * <p/>
    * Finally, notice that you can combine an ordered verification block that verifies the position of some calls
    * relative to others with a later unordered block which verifies some or all of those other invocations.
    * The unordered block should not come before, however, since it would "consume" the verified invocations.
