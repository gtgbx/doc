<p>
   In this tutorial we will examine the available mocking APIs, always with the help of relevant code snippets.
   Even though the tutorial is fairly complete, it does not attempt to cover the entire published API in detail.
   A more complete and detailed specification for all public classes, methods, etc. is provided through the
   <a href="../javadoc/overview-summary.html">API documentation</a>, which can also be found under the
   "jmockit/www/javadoc" folder inside the full toolkit distribution file.
   The main library file, "jmockit.jar", contains Java source files (with Javadoc comments) for easy access to the API
   source code and documentation from a Java IDE.
</p>
<p>
   The additional tools which are provided through separate jar files are also covered, in separate chapters of the
   tutorial.

<p>
   Software tests written by the developers themselves, to test their own code, are often very important for successful
   software development.
   Such tests are usually written with the help of a testing framework, such as
   <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Developer tests can be divided in two main categories:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <strong>Unit tests</strong>, intended to test a class or component in isolation from the rest of the system.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Integration tests</strong>, intended to test system operations that encompass a unit and its dependencies
      (other classes/components with which the unit under test interacts).
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   Even though integration tests include the interaction between multiple units, particular tests may not be interested
   in exercising all components, layers, or sub-systems involved.
   The ability to isolate the code under test from irrelevant parts of the system is therefore generally useful.
</p>

   Testing with mock objects

<p>
   A common and powerful technique for testing code in isolation is the use of "mocks".
   Traditionally, a <em>mock object</em> is an instance of a class specifically implemented for a single test or set of
   related tests.
   This instance is passed to code under test to take the place of one of its dependencies.
   Each mock object behaves in the way expected by both the code under test and the tests that use it, so that all tests
   can pass.
   That, however, is not the only role mock objects usually play.
   As a complement to the assertions performed by each test, the mock itself can encode additional assertions.
</p>
<p>
   The above is true for conventional mock object tools such as jMock and EasyMock (more about them in the next
   section).
   JMockit goes beyond conventional mock objects by allowing individual methods and constructors to be mocked directly
   on "real" (non-mock) classes, consequently eliminating the need to instantiate mock objects in tests and pass them to
   code under test; rather, the regular objects created by code under test will execute mock behavior defined by tests
   whenever methods or constructors are called on the real classes.
   In fact, with JMockit the original implementations of existing methods/constructors are replaced with mock
   implementations, usually for the duration of a single test.
   In addition, <code>static</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>private</code> and even <code>native</code> methods can
   have their implementations replaced, and therefore are also "mockable".
</p>
<p>
   Mocks are most useful for unit tests, but can also be used for integration tests.
   For example, you may want to test a presentation layer class along with its interactions with other classes in the
   same layer, without actually depending on the result of calls made to code in other application layers, such as the
   business or infrastructure layers.

<p>
   Existing tools for testing with mock objects include <a href="http://www.easymock.org">EasyMock</a> and
   <a href="http://www.jmock.org">jMock</a>, both of which are based on
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</a>,
   which can create at runtime an implementation for a given Java interface.
   It's also possible to create proxies for concrete classes through CGLIB-based subclass generation.
   Each tool has a rich API for expressing <em>expectations</em> that are verified as methods are called on mock
   instances, or at the end of the test.
   It's not uncommon to see JUnit tests with most or all checks written as EasyMock/jMock expectations, instead of with
   JUnit's own assertion methods.
</p>
<p>
   JMockit has its own <strong>Expectations API</strong>, which is similar to those APIs but goes beyond them by
   providing support for mocking all kinds of methods, constructors, and types (interfaces, abstract classes, final or
   non-final classes, classes from the JRE, enums, etc.).
</p>
<p>
   There is another group of mocking tools, which rely on <em>explicit verification</em> of expectations over
   <em>implicit verification</em>: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito">Mockito</a> and
   <a href="http://www.unitils.org/summary.html">Unitils Mock</a>.
   The common characteristic of all these mocking APIs is that they use direct invocations to mock objects as a way to
   specify expectations.
   In the case of EasyMock and jMock, such invocations can only be made <em>before</em> exercising the unit under test,
   in the so-called <em>record phase</em> of the test.
   In the case of Mockito and Unitils Mock, on the other hand, the invocations can also be made <em>after</em>
   exercising the tested unit, in the <em>verify phase</em> of the test.
   (The phase in between is the <em>replay phase</em>, during which the unit under test actually performs the
   invocations of interest on its mocked collaborators.)
   JMockit provides the <strong>Verifications API</strong>, a natural extension of the Expectations API, to allow the
   explicit verification of <em>non-strict</em> expectations in the "verify" phase (<em>strict</em> expectations are
   always verified implicitly).

<p>
   The conventional solutions for achieving isolation with mock objects impose certain design restrictions on the code
   under test.
   JMockit was created as an alternative with no such restrictions, by leveraging the facilities in the
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html"
   >java.lang.instrument</a> Java 6 package (in addition to making use of - to a lesser degree - reflection, dynamic
   proxies, and custom class loading).
</p>
<p>
   Because of certain technical limitations, the mocking tools previously mentioned impose some restrictions on the
   classes for which a mock object may be needed.
   Specifically, said classes must either implement a separate interface or all (instance) methods to be mocked must be
   overridable (ie, neither the class itself nor any of those methods can be declared to be <code>final</code>).
   Additionally, the instantiation of dependencies must be controlled from outside the dependent unit, so that a proxy
   object (the mock) can be passed to it in place of the "real" implementation for each dependency (see
   <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a>).
   That is, proxied classes can't simply be instantiated with the <code>new</code> operator in client code, because
   constructor invocations cannot be intercepted through conventional techniques.
</p>
<p>
   To sum up, these are the design restrictions that apply when using a conventional approach to mocking:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Application classes have to implement a separate interface (to enable the use of
      <code class="type">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>) or at least not be declared <code>final</code> (to enable the
      dynamic generation of a subclass with overriding methods).
      In this second case, no instance method to be mocked can be <code>final</code> either.
      <br/>
      Obviously, creating Java interfaces just so a mock implementation can exist is not desirable.
      Separate interfaces (or more generally, abstractions) should be created only when multiple implementations will
      exist in <em>production code</em>.
      <br/>
      In Java, making classes and methods <code>final</code> is optional, but it can be a great way to capture certain
      design decisions; additionally, it allows static analysis tools (such as Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, or your Java
      IDE) to provide useful warnings about the code (about, for example, a final method which declares to throw a
      specific checked exception, but doesn't actually throw it; such warning could not be given for a non-final method,
      since an override could throw the exception).
   </li>
   <li>
      No static methods for which a mock implementation might be needed can be used.
      <br/>
      In practice, this means that the use of a "static facade", otherwise a convenient solution to provide stateless
      utility methods or as an abstraction to a complex subsystem, is disallowed.
   </li>
   <li>
      All "mockable" methods must be public for mock classes that implement an interface, or at least non-private for
      mock subclasses.
      Usually private methods don't need to be mocked, but in certain situations it may be useful.
   </li>
   <li>
      Classes to be tested need to provide some way for tests to give them mock instances for their
      collaborators/dependencies.
      This usually means that extra setter methods or constructors are created in the dependent classes.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, dependent classes cannot simply use the <code>new</code> operator to obtain instances of their
      dependencies, even in situations where doing so would be appropriate.
      (Even when we have abstractions separated from their implementation classes, not all implementations need to be
      selected by client code or through configuration; neither do all kinds of dependencies need to be designed with
      separated interfaces.)
      <br/>
      The tendency to avoid appropriate uses of <code>new</code> is particularly insidious, often leading developers to
      over-engineer their designs by creating unnecessary abstractions and ultimately introducing complex application
      frameworks just to deal with the configuration of such abstractions and their (often unique) implementations.
      Also, it favors the use of stateless "objects", even when state specific to each operation is involved.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   With JMockit, <strong>any</strong> design can be tested in isolation without restricting the developer's freedom.
   Design decisions which have a negative effect on testability when using only traditional mock objects are
   inconsequential when using this new approach.
   In effect, testability becomes much less of an issue in application design, allowing developers to avoid complexities
   such as separate interfaces, factories, dependency injection and so on, when they aren't justified by actual system
   requirements.
