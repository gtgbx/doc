   Other coverage tools for Java include EMMA, Clover, <a href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net">Cobertura</a>, and
   <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco">JaCoCo</a>.
   (The latter being more often used through the <em>EclEmma</em> Eclipse plugin.)
   These tools provide two separate coverage metrics, namely <em>statement</em> and <em>branch</em> coverage.
   The first one is also called <em>line</em> coverage, even though they don't actually attempt to measure how much of
   the executable code in individual lines has been covered.
   The second measures how many of the alternative branches resulting from decision points (an <code>if</code> or
   <code>switch</code> statement) have been taken during a test run.
   JMockit Coverage uses a different, but related, set of coverage metrics.
</div>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage"><em>Code coverage</em></a> consists of a set of software metrics
that can tell you how much of the production code is covered by a given test suite.
It's purely quantitative, and does not say anything about the <em>quality</em> of either the production code or the
test code.
That said, the examination of code coverage reports will sometimes lead to the discovery of unreachable code which
can be eliminated.
But more importantly, such reports can be used as a guide for the discovery of missing tests.
This is not only useful when creating tests for existing production code, but also when writing tests first, such as
in the practice of TDD (Test Driven Development).
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="Coverage.png">
</div>
<p>
JMockit Coverage provides three different and complementary code coverage metrics:
<em>line coverage</em>, <em>path coverage</em>, and <em>data coverage</em>.
An example coverage report showing all metrics can be found <a href="../coverage-sample/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="line">
   Line coverage
   <span class="navigation">
      <a href="#path"><img src="go-down.png" title="Next section"></a>
      <a href="#top"><img src="go-up.png" title="Top"></a>

   </span>
</h3>
<p>
   The <em>line coverage</em> metric tells us how much of the <em>executable code</em> in a source file has been
   exercised by tests.
   Each executable line of code can be <em>uncovered</em>, <em>covered</em>, or <em>partially covered</em>.
   In the first case, <em>none</em> of the executable code in it was executed at all.
   In the second, <em>all</em> of the code was fully executed at least once.
   In the third case, only <em>part</em> of the executable code in the line was executed.
   This can happen, for example, with lines of code containing multiple logical conditions in a complex boolean
   expression.
   JMockit Coverage identifies all three cases, computing the <em>coverage percentage</em> for each executable line of
   code accordingly: <strong>0%</strong> for an uncovered line, <strong>100%</strong> for a covered line, or some value
   in between for a partially covered line.
</p>
<p>
   A <em>branching point</em> exists wherever the program makes a decision between two possible execution paths to
   follow.
   Any line of code containing a logical condition will be divided in at least two executable <em>segments</em>, each
   belonging to a separate <em>branch</em>.
   An executable line of source code with no branching points contains a single segment.
   Lines with one or more branching points contain two or more executable segments, separated by consecutive branching
   points in the line.
</p>
<p>
   Lets say that <code><strong>NS</strong> >= 1</code> is the number of executable segments on a given line.
   If <code><strong>NE</strong></code> is the number of segments in that line which were executed at least once during a
   test run (ie, they are <em>covered segments</em>), then we can calculate the coverage percentage for the line as
   <strong><code>100 * NE / NS</code></strong>.
</p>
<p>
   Similarly, the line coverage percentage for a whole source file is calculated from the total number of executable
   segments and the total number of covered segments, considering all executable lines of code in the file.
   The percentage for a <em>package</em>, in turn, is calculated from the total and covered numbers of segments in the
   whole set of source files belonging to the package.
   Finally, the <em>total code coverage</em> percentage is computed by the same formula on the totals for all packages.

   </span>
   Path coverage
</h3>
<p>
   A completely different metric is <em>path coverage</em>, which is computed for method and constructor bodies, not for
   lines or segments of code.
   It tells us how many of the possible <em>execution paths</em> through a method or constructor, from <em>entry</em> to
   <em>exit</em>, have been executed at least once during the test run.
</p>
<p>
   Note that each method or constructor has a single point of entry, but can have multiple exits.
   An exit occurs when a <code>return</code> or <code>throw</code> statement is executed.
   These are <em>normal exits</em>, of course. A method/constructor execution can also terminate <em>abruptly</em>, by
   propagating an exception (or error) thrown as a result of a method call, an attempt to access a <code>null</code>
   reference, or some other action which caused an unintended program failure.
</p>
<p>
   Each possible path can be either fully executed (covered) or not (uncovered).
   Paths that execute only partially (ie, they were terminated abruptly) are simply considered as uncovered.
</p>
<p>
   The <em>path coverage percentage</em> for a method or constructor body is computed in a way similar to the line
   coverage computation.
   If <code><strong>NP</strong></code> is the number of possible paths through the implementation body and
   <code><strong>NPE</strong></code> is the number of paths executed from entry to exit, then the metric is computed as
   <strong><code>100 * NPE / NP</code></strong>.
   Also in the same way as the line coverage metric, we extend this formula to the whole source file, the whole package,
   and the whole set of packages touched by the test run.

   Data coverage
</h3>
<p>
   Measures how many of the instance and static non-final <em>fields</em> were fully exercised by the test run.
   To be fully exercised, a field must have the last value assigned to it read by at least one test.
   The percentages are calculated as <code>100 * NFE / NF</code>, where <code>NF</code> is the number of non-final
   fields and <code>NFE</code> the number of fully exercised fields.

<p>
   The JMockit Coverage tool can generate the following types of output:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <strong>HTML reports</strong>: a multi-page HTML report is written in the "coverage-report" directory, under the
      current working directory (a different output directory can be specified if needed).
      The directory is created if it doesn't yet exist; its contents are overwritten if previously generated.
      The report will include pages containing all Java source files covered by the test suite.
      By default, the tool looks for "<code>.java</code>" source files inside all directories of name "<code>src</code>"
      found directly or indirectly under the current working directory; any intermediate sub-directories between
      "<code>src</code>" and the top-level package directory, such as "<code>src/java</code>" for example, are also
      searched.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Coverage data files</strong>: a single serialized file of name "<code>coverage.ser</code>" is written
      under the current working directory or an specified output directory.
      If the file already exists, its contents are either overwritten or <em>merged</em> with the in-memory results of
      the current test run, as specified.
      <br>
      These files can be read and processed by external tools.
      The <code>mockit.coverage.data.CoverageData.readDataFromFile(File)</code> method will create a new
      <code class="type">CoverageData</code> instance with all the coverage data available in a given serialized file.
      For more on this, refer to the API documentation available in <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code>.
   </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="callPoints">Call points</h4>
<p>
   When running a test suite with the coverage tool, there is optional "call point" information which can be gathered,
   as selected by the user.
   A <em>call point</em> is the point in the source test code from which an specific line of production code was
   exercised.
</p>
<p>
   Generating coverage with this extra information takes more time and produces significantly larger output;
   on the other hand, it can be useful to know which lines of test code caused a given line of production code to be
   executed during the test run.
   When included in the HTML report, the list of call points appears hidden at first but can be easily viewed by
   clicking on each executable line of code.
</p>

<p>
   To enable the JMockit Coverage tool in a JUnit/TestNG test run, add both <code>jmockit.jar</code> and
   <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> to the runtime classpath.
   With JUnit, make sure that <code>jmockit.jar</code> appears first in the classpath.
   (For more details on running tests with JMockit, see <a href="RunningTests.html">this page</a>.)
</p>
<p>
   When not using the JMockit mocking APIs, code coverage can still be activated without adding any jar to the
   classpath.
   Instead, run with "<code>-javaagent:&lt;proper path>/<strong>jmockit-coverage</strong>.jar</code>" as a JVM
   initialization parameter.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, the coverage tool does not require any additional configuration to be used.
   There are, however, several aspects of the tool's behavior which <em>can</em> optionally be configured for a given
   test run.
   This is done by setting one or more of several "<code>jmockit-coverage-<em>xyz</em></code>"
   <em>system properties</em> for the JVM instance running the test suite.
   For convenience, the "<code>jmockit-</code>" prefix can be omitted, so "<code>coverage-<em>xyz</em></code>" is also
   valid.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you should be able to easily specify these properties inside an Ant target, a Maven <code>surefire</code>
   plugin configuration, or a test run configuration for your Java IDE of choice, using either JUnit or TestNG; no
   JMockit-specific plugin is needed.
</p>
<p>
   The available configuration properties are:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>output</strong></code>: one or more comma-separated values between
      <strong><code>html</code></strong>, <strong><code>html-nocp</code></strong> ("nocp" stands for "no call points"),
      <strong><code>serial</code></strong>, and <strong><code>merge</code></strong>, which select the kind of output
      to be generated at the end of the test run.
      The default if none is specified is to generate the basic HTML report (<code>html-nocp</code>).
      <br/>
      The "html" and "html-nocp" values are mutually exclusive, just like "serial" and "merge".
      However, it <em>is</em> valid to have one of each pair specified at the same time.
      In such a case, at the end of the test run both kinds of output will be written.
      <br/>
      The presence of "<code>serial</code>" or "<code>merge</code>" causes a <em>serialized data file</em> of name
      "<code>coverage.ser</code>" to be generated; in the case of "<code>merge</code>", the contents of a previously
      existing data file (if any) will be <em>merged</em> with the coverage data gathered by the current test run
      (otherwise, it has the same effect as "<code>serial</code>").
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>outputDir</strong></code>: absolute or relative path to the output directory, to
      be used for writing any "<code>coverage.ser</code>" or "<code>index.html</code>" files (plus the remaining
      "<code>.html</code>" files of the HTML report, in automatically created sub-directories).
      By default, the current working directory of the running JVM is used, with all "<code>.html</code>" files of the
      HTML report generated inside a "<code>coverage-report</code>" sub-directory.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>srcDirs</strong></code>: comma-separated list of Java source directories to be
      searched when generating an HTML report.
      (This is not relevant for the serialized data file.)
      Each directory is specified by an absolute or relative path.
      If no such directory is specified, all "<code>src</code>" directories under the current working directory are
      searched.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>classes</strong></code>:
      Either an OS-like regular expression (with the typical "<code>*</code>" and "<code>?</code>" wildcards), or a
      <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex</a>-conformable
      regular expression.
      The given expression will be used to select the classes (by fully qualified name) from production code which
      should be considered for coverage.
      By default, all classes in production code loaded during the test run and which are not inside jar files are
      considered.
      <br/>
      For example, "<code>some.package.*</code>" selects all classes under <code>some.package</code> or any
      sub-package.
      <br/>
      As a special case, if the property is specified as "<code>loaded</code>", then all classes will be considered,
      but only those which get loaded by the JVM during the test run; classes that are part of the codebase but never
      get loaded are left out.
      This is very useful when the test run includes only a few tests, targeting only a subset of the codebase.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>excludes</strong></code>:
      The same as the previous property, but for class names which should be excluded from consideration when
      instrumenting classes for coverage.
      This property can be used together with <code>coverage-classes</code> or on its own.
      By default, no classes between those selected for coverage are excluded from consideration.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>metrics</strong></code>:
      one or more comma-separated words between <strong><code>line</code></strong> (the default),
      <strong><code>path</code></strong>, <strong><code>data</code></strong>, and <strong><code>all</code></strong>,
      which select the specific set of code coverage <strong>metrics</strong> to gather coverage information for.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>[jmockit-]coverage-<strong>check</strong></code>:
      one or more semicolon-separated rules specifying <em>minimum coverage</em> checks to be performed at the end of a
      test run.
      By default, no such checks are performed.
      For details, see the specific <a href="#checking">section</a> about this feature below.

<p>
   Suppose you have multiple test suites or test run configurations, and you want to generate a single HTML report for
   the code covered by the full set of tests.
   Normally, when JMockit Coverage generates a report at the end of a test run, it overwrites any previous report.
   Then, instead of getting a merged report as desired, you get the report for the last test run only.
   Here is where the "coverage.ser" serialized data files come in.
</p>
<p>
   To activate the generation of this file, we simply set the <code>coverage-output</code> system property to a value
   containing "<code>serial</code>" or "<code>merge</code>".
   As these two values suggest, there are different ways to combine multiple coverage data files.
   The following sub-sections provide the details for each case.
</p>

<h4 id="singleMergedReport">Generating a single aggregate report for a grouping of test runs</h4>
<p>
   Lets say we have multiple test run configurations (for example, multiple <code>junit</code> or <code>testng</code>
   tasks in the same Ant target) to be executed at once, and want to produce a single aggregate coverage report for the
   full set of tests.
   That is, we don't want to produce a separate report for each individual test run.
   The easiest way to achieve this is to use the same working directory for all test runs, with
   <strong><code>coverage-output=merge</code></strong> specified as a system property for each test run configuration.
   Since the HTML report is only desired at the end, the last test run configuration in the sequence should have the
   appropriate value specified in the <code>coverage-output</code> property.
   The "<code>coverage.ser</code>" file will be shared between all test runs.
   The first test run must <em>not</em> read data from this file; therefore, either the file should be deleted before
   the first test run, or ignored by having the first test run set <code>coverage-output=serial</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="separateAggregateReport">Generating an aggregate report from a set of data files</h4>
<p>
   Suppose we want to generate a separate coverage report for <em>each</em> test run configuration and also an
   aggregate report merging together the results from all test runs.
   In this case we would have <code>n</code> test runs but <code>n + 1</code> coverage reports.
   Only one HTML report can be produced from a single test run, so an extra step which doesn't execute any tests is
   necessary.
   In order to preserve the original <code>coverage.ser</code> output files generated by each test run, they will need
   to be written or copied into different output directories.
</p>
<p>
   Assuming that two or more <code>coverage.ser</code> files are available in separate directories, an aggregate report
   can be generated from them by executing the <code>mockit.coverage.CodeCoverage.main</code> method (a regular Java
   "main" method).
   To facilitate this, the <code>jmockit-coverage.jar</code> file is <em>executable</em>.
   Using Ant, the following task could be used:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;java fork="yes" dir="myBaseDir" jar="jmockit-coverage.jar">
   &lt;arg line="-Dcoverage-output=html module1-outDir anotherOutDir"/>
&lt;/java>
</code></pre>
<p>
   The example above uses "<code>myBaseDir</code>" as the base directory where a separate JVM instance will run.
   Two output directories containing "<code>coverage.ser</code>" data files are specified, as command line arguments.
   Other configuration parameters can be specified through the "<code>coverage-xyz</code>" system properties.
   This separate JVM instance will read each of the "<code>coverage.ser</code>" data files, merge the coverage data in
   memory, and then generate the aggregate HTML report before exiting.
</p>

<h3 id="checking">

</h3>
<p>
   If desired, JMockit Coverage can check that the final coverage percentages at the end of a test run satisfy arbitrary
   minimum values.
   Such checks can be specified through one or more <em>checking rules</em> assigned to the
   "<code>coverage-check</code>" system property (when more than one, they must be separated by ";" characters).
</p>
<p>
   Each checking rule must be in the form
   "[<em>scope</em>:]min <em>line</em> percentage[,min <em>path</em> percentage[,min <em>data</em> percentage]]".
   There are three types of scopes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <em>Total</em>: The default when no scope is specified. It refers to the total percentage for each metric.
      For example, the rule "<code>80</code>" specifies that the total line coverage should be at least 80%, with no
      minimum percentages for the other metrics.
      An example specifying thresholds for all three metrics could be "<code>70,60,85</code>".
      Note that a value of "<code>0</code>" can also be used to specify no minimum.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>perFile</code>: Specifies minimum percentages that <em>each</em> source file must satisfy. If one or more
      files end up with a lower percentage, the check fails.
      An example: "<code>perFile:50,0,40</code>", meaning that each source file must have at least 50% of line coverage
      and at least 40% of data coverage.
   </li>
   <li>
      <em>Package</em>: Specifies minimum total percentages for the set of source files in a given package, including
      sub-packages.
      For example, the rule "<code>com.important:90,70</code>" specifies that total line coverage for files under
      "<code>com.important</code>" should be at least 90%, while total path coverage should be at least 70%.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   All checks (if any) are performed at the end of the test run (at JVM shutdown, actually).
   Other forms of output (HTML report, serialized file) are not affected.
   When an individual check fails, a descriptive message is printed to standard output.
   If one or more checks have failed, two final actions are taken to have the fact reported: first, an empty file of
   name "<code>coverage.check.failed</code>" is created in the current working directory; second, an error
   (specifically, an <code class="type">AssertionError</code>) is thrown.
   When checks are performed but they all pass, the "<code>coverage.check.failed</code>" file, if present in the current
   directory, is deleted.
</p>
<p>
   The use of a file to mark the success or failure of coverage checks is meant to allow build tools to react
   accordingly, typically by failing the build when the file is present.
   For example, we can do the following in an Ant build script:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;fail message="Coverage check failed">
   &lt;condition>&lt;available file="<strong>coverage.check.failed</strong>"/>&lt;/condition>
&lt;/fail>
</code></pre>

   If you run tests with Maven's "test" goal, you will need the following dependencies in the <code>pom.xml</code> file
   (assuming the "<code>version</code>" properties have been properly defined):
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;dependency>
   &lt;groupId><strong>org.jmockit</strong>&lt;/groupId>
   &lt;artifactId><strong>jmockit</strong>&lt;/artifactId>
   &lt;version><strong>${jmockit.version}</strong>&lt;/version>
   &lt;scope>test&lt;/scope>
&lt;/dependency>
&lt;dependency>
   &lt;groupId><strong>org.jmockit</strong>&lt;/groupId>
   &lt;artifactId><strong>jmockit-coverage</strong>&lt;/artifactId>
   &lt;version><strong>${jmockit.coverage.version}</strong>&lt;/version>
   &lt;scope>runtime&lt;/scope>
&lt;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>
   In Maven 2/3, the <code>surefire</code> plugin is the one usually responsible for actually running tests.
   To configure the coverage tool, specify values for the appropriate "<code>coverage-xyz</code>" system properties.
   For example, the output directory for generated files can be specified through the <code>coverage-outputDir</code>
   property.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;plugin>
   &lt;artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
   &lt;configuration>
      &lt;systemPropertyVariables>
         <strong>&lt;coverage-outputDir>target/my-coverage-report&lt;/coverage-outputDir></strong>
         &lt;!-- other properties, if needed -->
      &lt;/systemPropertyVariables>
   &lt;/configuration>
&lt;/plugin>
</code></pre>
<p>
   Finally, if the tests don't actually use the JMockit mocking APIs, it's still possible to use the coverage tool.
   In this case, the only dependency needed is the one on "<code>jmockit-coverage</code>".
   Additionally, it's necessary to configure the <code>surefire</code> plugin as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;plugin>
   &lt;artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
   &lt;configuration>
      &lt;argLine>
<strong>-javaagent:"${settings.localRepository}"/org/jmockit/jmockit-coverage/${jmockit.coverage.version}/
jmockit-coverage-${jmockit.coverage.version}.jar</strong>
         &lt;!-- coverage properties, if any are needed -->
      &lt;/argLine>
   &lt;/configuration>
&lt;/plugin>
</code></pre>

<h4 id="site">Including the HTML report in a Maven site</h4>
<p>
   To have the JMockit Coverage HTML report included in the generated
   <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html">Maven site</a> documentation, the
   <code>src/site/site.xml</code> descriptor file needs to be provided, with contents similar to what's shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;project
   xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/DECORATION/1.3.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

   Turning coverage output off

<p>
   Sometimes we want to turn coverage output off for a particular test run, without having to remove the coverage jar
   from the classpath.
   This can be done in two different ways.
</p>
<p>
   For one, we can manipulate the <em>read-only attribute</em> of the relevant output file, when one has already been
   generated.
   The particular file to be manipulated, always in the working directory, is "<code>coverage.ser</code>" for serialized
   output or "<code>coverage-report/index.html</code>" for HTML output.
   The file attribute is checked by JMockit at startup; when marked as read-only it cannot be overwritten, so JMockit
   avoids the attempt entirely.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the working directory can usually be selected separately for each test run configuration in the Java IDE.
   Also, a Java IDE usually provides an easy mechanism to toggle the read-only status of a file in the project:
   in IntelliJ IDEA it is done by double clicking the status bar, with the desired file opened in the editor;
   in Eclipse there is a "Read only" check box in the "Properties" screen (which can be opened by typing "Alt+Enter")
   for the text file selected in the editor.
</p>
<p>
   Another way to switch coverage off is to simply set the <strong><code>coverage-output</code></strong> system property
   to an unknown output format, such as "<code>-Dcoverage-output=<strong>none</strong></code>".
</p>

   Standalone mode

<p>
   In previous sections we described the most typical way to use the coverage tool, by enabling it during a JUnit/TestNG
   test run to measure <em>test</em> coverage.
   The tool can also be used in a more general context, though: the <em>standalone</em> mode, where it can attach to
   <em>any</em> Java 6+ process to measure line and path coverage metrics on specified classes, regardless of which code
   is making calls into said classes.
</p>
<p>
   To activate standalone mode, the target JVM instance must be started with the
   "<code>-javaagent:&lt;proper/path/>jmockit-coverage.jar</code>" command line argument.
   That's it; none of the JMockit toolkit jars need to be present in the classpath of the target process.
   Initial configuration settings for the coverage tool can be specified through the "<code>coverage-xyz</code>" system
   properties previously described, but this is entirely optional; the configuration properties can be modified later
   through a dedicated UI.
</p>
<p>
   Once the target process is running with the JMockit Coverage Java agent, the user should connect to it with a JMX
   client which can access arbitrary "MBeans".
   Usually, the standard
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html">JConsole</a> tool
   available in a Java 6+ JDK will be used.
   The JMockit Coverage MBean provides several configuration properties (the same ones which can be set with
   "<code>-D</code>" on the command line), and one operation through which the desired output can be generated.
   The user interface provided by JConsole is shown below, where the process that is running with the coverage tool is a
   Tomcat 7 server instance.
</p>
<img src="mbeanUI.png" title="User interface presented by the JConsole tool, after connecting to a Tomcat instance
   started with the JMockit Coverage agent.">
<p>
   The configuration properties (shown as "Attributes" of the "CoverageControl" MBean above) are as before, except in
   the case of "SrcDirs" (which corresponds to <code>coverage-srcDirs</code>).
   If this property is not specified, no attempt is made to find source files for the classes considered for coverage.
