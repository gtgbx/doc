 * This class is used to run animated transitions in an application.

 * {@code ScreenTransition} is given a container in a Swing application.
 * When the application wishes to transition from one state of the application to another, the {@link #start()} method

    * Implementation detail: The key to making ScreenTransition work correctly is having two
    * different views or layers of ScreenTransition under the covers.  One layer is the
    * "containerLayer", which is where the actual child components of ScreenTransition are placed.
    * The other (more hidden) layer is the "animationLayer", which exists solely for displaying the
    * animations which take place during any transition.
    *
    * The reason we cannot animate the transitions in the same container where the actual components
    * live (at least not trivially) is that we need to layout the container for both states of a
    * transition prior to actually running the animation.  Moving the components around during these
    * layout phases cannot happen onscreen (the net effect would be that the user would see the end
    * result before the transition), so we do the layout on an invisible container instead.  Then
    * the animation happens to transition between the two states, in his separate animationLayer.
    *
    * Further detail: the "animationLayer" is set to be the glass pane of the application frame.
    * Glass pane already has the functionality we need (specifically, it overlays the area that we
    * need to render during the transition); the only trick is that we must position the rendering
    * correctly since the glass pane typically covers the entire application frame, but in this case
    * the transition container may only occupy a portion of the frame.
