/**
 * This package contains the built-in effects used by the Animated Transitions library.
 * <p>
 * Some of these effects, such as {@link Move}, {@link Scale}, {@link FadeIn}, and {@link FadeOut}
 * are used automatically by the library, based on which transition type a component undergoes
 * during a transition.  These effects, and the others in this package, are available for use by
 * applications, either on their own or in combination with other effects by using
 * {@link CompositeEffect}. See {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.TransitionType} for more
 * information on using custom effects.
