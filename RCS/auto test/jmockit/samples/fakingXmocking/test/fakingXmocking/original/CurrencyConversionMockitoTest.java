/**
 * This test class shows that it's trivial to make the original CurrencyConversion "testable"
 * (in the sense of allowing a conventional mocking tool to be used).
 * After this initial refactoring, passing unit tests can be written and then used to prevent the
 * introduction of bugs during more extensive refactoring.
 * <p/>
 * Applying more elaborate refactorings before being able to create a set of tests should not be recommended,
 * due to the increased risk of breaking existing functionality not yet covered by automated tests.
 * For example, extracting "untestable" blocks of code into new helper methods in the tested class may allow
 * said methods to be mocked away, but only at the cost of applying "partial" mocking, a technique which very
 * much goes against the idea that the <em>collaborators</em> of a tested class should be mocked, not parts
 * of the tested class itself.
 * <p/>
 * This experiment shows that, while the use of a mocking tool with limitations in what it can mock
 * (or the use of no mocking tool at all) does force some refactoring of the tested code, there is
 * no guarantee that the developer will refactor it "enough" to reach a desired quality level.
 * Such a guarantee can only be obtained from the judicious use of static analysis tools and peer reviews.
 * <p/>
 * Another observation from these particular tests is that they can give a false sense of security, given
 * that actual calls to the "httpClient" collaborator are not verified.
 * Such verifications could easily be added through {@code verify(httpClient).execute(...)} calls, but they
 * would introduce duplicate code in the test method;
 * as a consequence, developers may feel inclined to leave them out.
